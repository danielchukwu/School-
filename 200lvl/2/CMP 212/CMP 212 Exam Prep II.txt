ARRAYS
1a. What is an Array?
Ans: An array is a group of objects referenced with the same variable name
     OR
     An array is a collection of variables of the same data type and are reffered to through a common name
   
     Extra: Array contains elements(or objects)
            Array elements are also variables 
            You dimension an array when you use it for the first time
            Each element in an array is referred to by an array variable

 b. Discuss Arrays?
 Ans: An array is a set of items, of the same type, which are arranged in a way that an ordered set of integers uniquely defines the positions of each item(element) in the array.
      Array provides a method of accessing each item directly. 
      Each individual in the ordered set is called a subscript.

 c. What is the Dimenstion of an Array?
 Ans: If the number of elements in the ordered set of subscripts is N, then the array is said to be of one-dimension N.

      Extra: When there is only one subscript, the array is said to be one-dimensional
             When there are two subscripts, the array is said to be two-dimensional
             When there are three subscripts, the array is said to be three-dimensional
             But Generally, when there are more than ONE subscripts, the array is said to be multi-dimensional

 d. What is the size of the following Arrays?
    a = [1;4;17;3;90;79;4;6;81]
    b = [5;62;34;7;77;41;51]
    c = [9,2,13]
 Ans: Array a is of size 9
      Array b is of size 7
      Array c is of size 3

 e. Given the array below
    a = [1;4;17;3;90;79;4;6;81]
    What will be the result of the below?
    a[4] = ?
    a[7] = ?
    a[3] = ?
    a[5] = ?
    a[1] = ?

 Ans: a[4] = 90
      a[7] = 6
      a[3] = 3
      a[5] = 79
      a[1] = 4
      a[0] = 1



2a. What is the format for declaring an Array?
 Ans: data-type Array-name[Array-Size]

 b. What are the types of array declarations(C/C++) below?
    int Array1[5];
    int Array2[2][6];
    int Arrayy[5][5][5];
 Ans: int Array1[5];   is a one-dimensional array
      int Array2[2][6];    is a two-dimensional array
      int Arrayy[5][5][5];     is a three-dimensional array

 c. The above declarations are sized declarations. Declare an unsized one-dimensional Array and assign it values(or elements)?
 Ans: int grade[] = {20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100};   // comment: we can add as much as we want because this is an unsized one-dimensional array

 c1. Declare a sized array with size 5 and assign it elements   
 Ans: int ratings[5] = {45, 80, 92, 77, 89};  // comment: this is a sized array of a maximum of 5 elements. Adding more would do not work and will result in an error

 d. Declare a sized two-dimensional Array of size 3 and 1 and assign values(elements) to it?
 Ans: char letter[3] [4] = {
          'a', 'b', 'c', 'd',
          'e', 'f', 'g', 'h',
          'i', 'j', 'l', 'm'};

 d. Declare a two-dimensional Array of the first unsized and the second sized(2) and assign it several characters?
 Ans: char list5[] [2] = {   // comment: Here we have a a two-dimensional array. the 1st dimension is unsized, while the second is with maximum of 2 elements
         'a', 'A',
         'b', 'B',
         'c', 'C',
         'd', 'D',
         'e', 'E',
         'f', 'F',
         'g', 'G'};
 




 Using C++ and Basic
 2a. A programming class has 5 students. Each programming assignment test is graded on a scale of 0 to 100. The grades earned 
    by the class in a single assignment can be arranged in the form of an array called GRADE1?
 Ans: // In C++ Programming Language
      int GRADE1[5] = {34, 68, 73, 88, 55};    // comment: grades not given therefore we can add any grade of our choice
 
      // In BASIC Programming Language
      GRADE1:
      _______
      
      | 34  |

      ------- 
      _______
      
      | 68  |

      ------- 
      _______
      
      | 73  |

      ------- 
      _______
      
      | 88  |

      ------- 
      _______
      
      | 55  |

      ------- 

 

 b. In a programming class five students take 4 programming tests and each grade graded on a scale of 0 to 100. Write a BASIC program that shows this?
 Ans:
      GRADE2:                         // comment: we use a two-dimensional array = of size 5 rows (for students) and 4 columns (for test grades)
                    TESTS             // comment: we picked arbitrary(random) grades for student 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
      Students    1    2    3    4
      ----------------------------
          1       92   75   82   55
          2       75   60   70   45
          3       60   17   50   40
          4       35   80   65   44
          5       70   75   77   51
 
 c. Using our above GRADE2 two-dimensional array. what will be the result of the subscripts
    GRADE2(1,1)
    GRADE2(3,3)
    GRADE2(4,2)
    GRADE2(2,4)
    GRADE2(5,4)
 Ans: GRADE2(1,1) = 92
      GRADE2(3,3) = 50
      GRADE2(4,2) = 80
      GRADE2(2,4) = 45
      GRADE2(5,4) = 51

 d. Declare a two-dimensional Array with max row 10, and max column 5 using C++ (array type should be float)?
 Ans: const int MAX_ROWS = 10;
      const int MAX_COLUMNS =5;

      float twoDimAry[MAX_ROWS][MAX_COLUMNS];

 d1. Write a code to fill the twoDimAry Array with Zeros
 Ans: 
      for (int column = 0; column<MAX_COLUMNS; column++){

          for (int row = 0; row<MAX_ROWS; row++){
              twoDimAry[row][column] = 0.0;      // comment: this should now assign a float 0 to every position on each loop
          }

      }
