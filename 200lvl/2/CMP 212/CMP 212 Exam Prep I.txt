INTRODUCTION & REPRESENTATION OF NUMBERS



Data Type Classification:
1a. What are the 4 major data types?
 Ans: a) Integers
      b) Real Numbers
      c) Characters
      d) Booleans

 b. Explain the following: Integers, Real Numbers(or real), Characters, Booleans?
 Ans: Integers: are simple numbers that do not contain fractional parts such as 5 -52, and 3,422
      Real: numbers are numbers that include fractional parts such as 2.5, 3.667, -5.0, .00034
      Characters: All of the symbols that can be produced by pressing keys on a keyboard. Characters are used to generate human readable text such as English sentences. 
                  The data type Char is used to represent Characters
      Booleans: The values false and true

 
 Primitive Data Types
 c. What are Primitive Data Types?
 Ans: Primitive Data Types are the native data types that every computer language support. 
      Extra: 
      These types may be native(meaning built-in) either to the machine on which the programs are running or to the compiler or interpreter that is translating these programs
 
 d. What are Fixed-Point Representation of Real Numbers
 Ans: This is the usual way of representing real nmbers with the decimal point fixed in its correct position between the two appropriate digits, e.g 13.75 or 3862.4 . 
      However this becomes cumbersome(difficult to handle) when dealing with several large or very small numbers e.g. 137500000000, or 0.000000001375

 The Answer for Fixed-Point Representation of Real Numbers when dealing with very large or very small numbers is to use the -> Floating-Pont Notation

 
2a. What is the concept of Floating-Point Notation?
 Ans: The key concept is that a real number is represented by a number, called a MANTISSA, times a BASE raised to an integer power called an EXPONENT. 

      Extra: The BASE is usually fixed(10) and the MANTISSA and Exponent vary to represent different real numbers(that are too large(e.g 380000000000000) 
              or too small(e.g 0.0000000000000038))


Explanation of Floating-Point Notation of Numbers
 
 Floating-Point Notation for large numbers
 For decimals
 A. 387.53
 Methods: positive, negative(whichever you want)
 - To get the floating-point representation(
   a. count numbers after dot (.53) --> which is 2
   b. add 2 to BASE 10 (negatively) --> 10¯²
   c. 38753 * 10¯² = 387.53
   d. Therefore: floating-point notation for 387.53 is = 38753 * 10¯²
   e. MANTISSA is 38753 and BASE is 10¯²

 - Positive
   a. count numbers before dot except the first number 3 (87.) --> which is 2
   b. add 3 to BASE 10 (positively) --> 10³
   c. 3.8753 * 10² = 387.53
   d. Therefore: floating-point notation for 387.53 is = 3.8753 * 10²
   e. MANTISSA is 3.8753 and BASE is 10²

 B. 1.399
 Only 1 way: 10⁰
 Steps:
 - 1.399 * 10⁰ = 1.399

 For Whole Numbers
 C. 640,000
 Only 1 way: positive
 Steps:
 - To get the floating-point representation(
   a. count numbers after the first number 6 (40,000) --> which is 5
   b. add 5 to BASE 10 (positively) --> 10⁵
   c. 6.4 * 10⁵ = 640,000
   d. Therefore: floating-point notation for 640,000 is = 6.4 * 10⁵
   e. MANTISSA is 6.4 and BASE is 10⁵

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
3a. What is Scientific Notation?
 Ans: The scientific notation is a floating-point method of representing a number, especially a very large number or very small one, in which numbers are expressed as products 
      consisting of a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10

 b Scientific Notation commonly uses the letter ______ in place of times 10(e.g 6.4 * 10⁵ --> 6.4E5 or 6.4E+05)
 Ans: E
 
 c. List all the 3 number representation forms?
 Ans: Fixed Point Representation
      Floating-point Representation
      Scientific Notation Representationn
