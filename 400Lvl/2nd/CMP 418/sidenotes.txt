Lect:If you understand the concept of swapping in sorting, u've completed 50% of this course

Sorting Algorithms
- Brute force
- Selection sort (Comparing j with i)
- Bubble sort (Comparing j with j)
  Tip: By so doing we increase the complexity of the algorithm


Loop: Path of your program that executes repeatedly
Iteration: Each step of the loop
Pass: The number of times a set of iteration occurs (1 complete iteration)

Expensiveness
Selection sort occurs at Theta of N
Bubble sort occurs at  Theta of NÂ² (More number)

Exam Question
- 1 compulsory question
- Your Exam is going to be 6 questions answer 4
- Differentiate  between bubble sort and selection sort
Ans: Bubble sort has a higher number of swapping


Sequential sort
pattern=m
text=n

e.g n can be alist that contains the names of everybody in the class
    m can be a the string we are trying to find

e.g 
text = mark markus mat
pattern = us

solution
# we keep iterating till we find a match
mark markus mat
         us     # match found
