     - Black hat hackers: are cyber criminals who orchestrate 
       scams and exploit vulnerabilities with the intent to 
       cause harm. The aim of black hat hackers is usually to 
       make money.
     - Gray hat hackers: infiltrate systems without their 
       targets’ consent, but they don’t exploit 
       vulnerabilities to cause harm. Instead, they inform 
       the victims of the hack in order to help them improve 
       their security.
     - Red hat hackers: Red hat hackers see themselves as the 
       “superheroes” of the hacking world. They 
       typically target black hat hackers to disrupt their 
       attacks or retaliate against them.
     - Malicious insider (whistleblower): is someone who 
       works for an organization and decides to expose 
       wrongdoing from within
     - Blue hat hackers: are white hat hackers who 
       are employed by an organization. Their job is to 
       maintain the cybersecurity of the organization and 
       prevent attacks.
     - Script kiddies and green hat hackers: These are 
       inexperienced hackers, they use existing malware and 
       scripts created by other hackers to launch their 
       attacks.
     - Hacktivists: Hacktivists are people who hack into 
       systems to fight back against perceived political or 
       social injustice.
     - State/nation-sponsored hackers: State-sponsored 
       hackers work for governments. Some are white hat 
       hackers who work to improve national cybersecurity, 
       but others use black hat tactics to harm other 
       countries.

g. What is Cryptography?
ans: Cryptography is a technique used to encrypt plaintext 
     (or main text) which makes it difficult to understand 
     and interpret by unauthorized user.

g1. Draw a diagram of the Cryptography process?
ans: Slide 1 (page 47)

h. List 3 types of Cryptography algorithm used as solutions 
   to Security Threats?
ans: - Secret key Encryption
     - Public key Encryption
     - Message digest

h1. Explain all listed above?
ans: - Secret key: In secrete key encryption, both the sender 
       and receiver have one secrete key. The secrete key is 
       used to encrypt the plain text from the senders end to 
       cypher text and the same secrete key at receiver end 
       will decrypt the data to plain text.
     - Public key: In this encryption system, every user has 
       its own secrete key, the secrete key is not revealed 
       on public domain. The senders use this key to encrypt 
       the plaintext and every users uses his own secrete key 
       to decrypt the cypher text to plain text.
     - Message digest: In this encryption system, actual data 
       is not sent, instead a hash value is calculated and 
       sent. The receiver computes his own hash value and 
       compares with the one just received if both hash value 
       are matched, then it is accepted, otherwise rejected













Section 2I (PAGE 101 - 105)
Network Protocols









2Ia. What is Network Protocol?
ans: Network Protocol is a set of rules outlining how connected
     devices communicate across a network to exchange 
     information easily and safely

b. List the types of Protocols?
ans: - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
     - Internet Protocol (IP)
     - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
     - Post office Protocol (POP)

c. Explain all 4 types mentioned?
ans: - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): is a communications
       standard that enables application programs and computing 
       devices to exchange messages over a network. It is 
       designed to send packets across the internet and ensure 
       the successful delivery of data and messages over 
       networks
       
       TCP organizes data so that it can be transmitted between 
       a server and a client. It guarantees the integrity of 
       the data being communicated over a network
       
       TCP establishes a connection between a source and its 
       destination, which it ensures remains live until 
       communication begins

     - Internet Protocol (IP): The Internet Protocol (IP) is a 
       set of standards for addressing and routing data on the 
       Internet.
       Each computer -- known as a host -- on the internet has 
       at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from 
       all other computers on the internet.
       message is divided into chunks called packets. Each 
       packet contains both the sender's internet address and 
       the receiver's address.
       Any packet is sent first to a gateway computer that 
       understands a small part of the internet.  

     - User Datagram Protocol (UDP): User Datagram Protocol 
       (UDP) is a communications protocol for time-sensitive 
       applications like gaming, playing videos, etc.
       UDP results in speedier communication because it does 
       not spend time forming a firm connection with the 
       destination before transferring the data.
       Because establishing the connection takes time, 
       eliminating this step results in faster data transfer 
       speeds. 
       UDP can also cause data packets to get lost as they go 
       from the source to the destination. It can also make it 
       relatively easy for a hacker to execute a distributed 
       denial-of-service (DDoS) attack

     another using electronic circuits

h1. Draw a diagram of Data Communication Circuits?
ans: Slide 1 (page 169)

h2. Discuss what takes place on each step in the above diagram?
ans: - Source: This device generates the data to be transmitted; examples 
       are mainframe computer, personal computer, workstation Mobile 
       Station etc. The source equipment provides a means for humans to 
       enter data into system.
     - Transmitter: A transmitter transforms and encodes the information 
       in such a way as to produce electromagnetic signals that can be 
       transmitted across some sort of transmission system. For example, a 
       modem takes a digital bit stream from an attached device such as a 
       personal computer and transforms that bit stream into an analog 
       signal that can be handled by the telephone network.
     - Transmission medium: The transmission medium carries the 
       electromagnetic signals from the transmitter to the receiver. 
       Different types of transmission media include free-space radio 
       transmission (wireless transmission) and physical facilities such as 
       metallic and optical fiber cables. 
     - Receiver: The receiver accepts the signal from the transmission 
       medium and converts it into a form that can be handled by the 
       destination device. For example, a modem will accept an analog 
       signal coming from a network or transmission line and convert it 
       into a digital bit stream.
     - Destination: Takes the incoming data from the receiver and can be 
       any kind of digital equipment like the source

     1 Mbps = 1024 Kbps       
     1 Gbps = 1024 Mbps  
     1 Tbps = 1024 Gbps

j8. What is the formula for calculating Data Transfer Rate speed?
ans: S = A ÷ T
     where:
     S = speed (or rate) of transfer
     A = Amount of data
     T = Time 

j9. Calculation. Determine the speed or the rate of transfer 
    of 25 megabyte(mb) in 2 min.
ans: S = A ÷ T
     where:
     A = 25mb
     T = 2min * 60sec = 120sec
     S = 25mb ÷ 120sec = 0.208mbps
     #Convert mbps to Kbps
     0.208mbps * 1024kbps = 212.9kbps

j10. Calculation. You transferred 100 GB at a rate of 7 MB/s. 
     Compute the Time required for the transfer.
ans: T = A ÷ S
     where:
     T = ?
     A = 100gb
     S = 7mbps
     # convert 100gb to mb
     100gb * 1024mb = 102400mb
     T = 102400mb ÷ 7mbps
       = 14628.6sec
     # convert to hour
     14628.6sec ÷ 60 ÷ 60 = 4.06hours

j11. A user wants to upload a text document at the rate of 
     10 pages per 20 seconds. What will be the required data 
     rate of the  channel ?. Assume that 1 page contains 1600 
     characters and each character is of 8 bits.
ans: S = A ÷ T
     where:
     A = 10pages * 1600 characters * 8bits = 128000bits
     T = 20seconds
     S = 128000bits/20seconds
     S = 6400bps
     # convert to Kbps
       = 6400bps ÷ 1024b
       = 6.25kbps

     - First generation cellular telephone also used FDM

i. Discuss WDM?
ans: - WDM is an analogue multiplexing technique.
     - Works same as FDM
     - In WDM, different signals are light signals that are 
       transmitted through optical fiber.
     - Various light wires from different sources are 
       combined to form a composite light signal that is 
       transmitted across the channel to the receiver.
     - At the receiving end, this composite light signal is
       broken into different light waves by demultiplex.
     - This combination and the splitting of light waves is
       done by using a PRISM. Prism bends beam of the light 
       based on the angle of incidence and the frequency of 
       light wave

5a. What is Network Switching?
ans: It is the technique used for transferring data or 
     information from one computer network to another network

     Additionally:
     - Network switches operate at layer 2 (Data link layer) 
       in the OSI model
     - Switching is transparent to the user and does not 
       require any configuration in the home network
     - Switches are used to forward the packets based on MAC
       addresses.
     - It is operated in full duplex mode.
     - Packet collision is minimum as it directly 
       communicates between source and destination.

b. What is a switch?
ans: It is a hardware device which is used to join multiple 
     computers together with one local area network (LAN)

c. What is ingress?
ans: The incoming data to a port/node

d. What is the outgoing data from a port/node?
ans: egress

e. Why is the Switching Concept required?
ans: - Bandwidth
     - Collision

f. List the advantages of Switching?
ans: - Switch increases the bandwidth of the network
     - It reduces the workload on individual PCs as it sends 
       the information to only that device which has been 
       addressed.
     - It increases the overall performance of the network by 
       reducing the traffic on the network.
     - There will be less frame collision as switch creates 
       the collision domain for each connection

g. List the disadvantages of Switching?
ans: - A Switch is more expensive than network bridges.
     - A Switch cannot determine the network connectivity 
       issues easily.
     - Proper designing and configuration of the switch are 
       required to handle multicast packets

h. What is a switch in the Computer Network?
ans: it refers to the networking devices that operate at an 
     OSI model’s layer 2 or data link layer.

     Additionally:
     - They establish connections between networked devices 
       and employ packet switching to transmit, receive, or 
       forward data packets or frames over the network.
     - There are numerous ports on a switch where computers 
       can be connected. 
     - A network switch evaluates the destination address of 
       each data frame that enters one of its ports, runs any 
       necessary checks, and then sends the frame to the 
       appropriate device(s).
     - It enables broadcast, multicast, and unicast 
       communication.

i. List the features of Switches?
ans: - Switches function in the OSI model’s layer 2 or data 
       connection layer.
     - It is a smart network appliance that resembles a 
       multiport network bridge.
     - The media access control (MAC) sublayer addresses are 
       used to transport data packets to certain target ports.
     - It uses packet switching technology to transmit data 
       packets (from the source device to the target device).
     - It allows one-to-one (unicast), one-to-many 
       (multicast), and one-to-all (broadcast) communications.
     - Full duplex transmission (means that communication in 
       the channel happens in both directions at once. As a 
       result, collisions do not happen).
     - Switches are operational hardware that has network 
       management and software capabilities.
     - They can carry out error checking before sending data 
       to the target port.
     - There are a total of 24/48 ports (which is more than 
       usual)

j. List the types of switches?
ans: - Unmanaged Switch
     - Managed Switch

k. Discuss Circuit Switching?
ans: - Transmission of data between two nodes are done over 
       a dedicated communication path.
     - A pre-specified route is created for which data 
       travels and no other data is permitted.
     - Transmission in circuit switching have to go through 
       three phases.
       - Establish a circuit
       - Transfer the data.
       - Disconnect the circuit
     Circuit switching are primarily design for voice communications. Before a user can make a call, a virtual path between caller and callee is established over the network.

l. Discuss Packet Switching?
ans: - Transmission data is broken down into smaller chunks 
       called packets.
     - A switching information is added in the header of each 
       packets.
     - Data transmission of packets over the network is done 
       independently.
     - These packets are sometime store on the intermediate 
       networking devices and they do not take much resources 
       either on carried path or in the memory of switches.
     - Packets switching enhances transmission efficiently as 
       packets from multiple communication channels can be 
       multiplexed.
     - The internet uses packets switching techniques.
     - Packet are stored and forwarded according to their 
       priority to providing quality of service.

l1. List the 2 types of Packet Switching?
ans: - Connectionless Communication
     - Connection-oriented communication

m. Discuss Message Switching?
ans: - This technique is somewhere in the middle of circuit 
       switching and packets switching.
     - In message switching, the whole data is treated as a 
       data unit, and is transmitted in its entirety (whole).
     - A switch receives the whole data unit and buffers it 
       until there are resources available to transfer it to 
       the next node.
     - If the next node does not have enough resource to 
       accommodate the data unit, the data unit have to waits 
       on the current node.
     - Message switching has the following drawbacks
       - Every switch in the transit path needs enough storage 
         to accommodate entire message.
       - Because of the store-and-forward technique and waits 
         of the availability of resources, message switching 
         is very slow.
       - Message switching is not suitable for real time 
         application.

n. List at least 5 benefits of Packet switching over the 
   others?
ans: - Packets switching ensures that no user monopolize any 
       transmission line very long, 
     - it is suited for handling interactive traffic
     - Packet switching reduce delay and improve throughput 
       than message switching
     - Packet switching does not require any advance setup,
       while circuit switching requires that a circuit be 
       setup end to end before communication begins
     - Packet switching is more fault tolerant than circuit 
       switching.
     - Packet switching does not waste bandwidth

5a. What is wave?
ans: A wave is a disturbance in a medium that carries
     energy without a net movement of particles

b. What are the 2 basic types of waves?
ans: Longitudinal and Transverse

c. Explain Longitudinal and Transverse waves?
ans: - With longitudinal waves, the displacement is 
       parallel in the direction of propagation e.g. 
       Earthquake, ultrasound, sound waves in air, etc.
     - With transverse waves, the displacement is 
       perpendicular to the direction of propagation. e.g Electromagnetic waves, guitar string, etc.

d. What are the 3 main characteristics of Electromagnetic 
   waves
ans: - Wave velocity
     - Frequency
     - Wavelength
