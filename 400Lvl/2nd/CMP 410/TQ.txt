Answers

1a. Define Multiplexing in the context of computer networks?
ans: Multiplexing is a technique used in computer networks to combine multiple 
     signals or data streams into a single signal over a shared medium. This 
     process allows multiple communication channels to be transmitted 
     simultaneously over a single physical link, making efficient use of 
     available bandwidth.
b. Why is multiplexing important in network communications.
ans: - Efficient Utilization of Resources: By allowing multiple data streams 
       to share the same communication channel, multiplexing maximizes the use 
       of available bandwidth, reducing the need for additional physical links.
     - Cost Reduction: Multiplexing minimizes the need for separate physical 
       connections for each communication channel, leading to lower infrastructure costs.
     - Scalability: It enables the network to support more users and devices 
       without requiring additional resources, making it easier to scale the 
       network.
     - Improved Data Transmission: Multiplexing can increase the data 
       transmission rate by allowing multiple channels to be transmitted 
       simultaneously, which is essential in high-speed networks

c. Explain the differences between TDM and FDM, provide example of where each 
    method is used?
ans: FDM
     - It is an analog technique.
     - Signals of different frequencies are combine into a 
       composite signal and is transmitted through a single 
       link.
     - Bandwidth of the link should be greater than the 
       combined bandwidth of the various channels.
     - Each signal has different frequency.
     - Channels are separated by the strips of unused 
       bandwidth called Guard Bands (to prevent overlapping)
    TDM
    - It is the digital multiplexing technique
    - Channel or link is divided on the  basis of time.
    - Total time available in the channel is divided between 
      several users.
    - Each user is allotted a particular time interval 
      called time slot or slice.
    - In TDM the data rate capacity of the transmission 
      medium should be greater than the data rate required 
      by sending and receiving devices

ans: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Frequency Division Multiplexing 
     (FDM) are two common types of multiplexing methods:

      - Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):
        - Mechanism: TDM divides the time domain into several slots, and each 
          channel is assigned a specific time slot in which it can transmit 
          its data. The time slots are rotated in a sequence, allowing 
          multiple channels to share the same frequency.
        - Example of Use: TDM is commonly used in digital telephony systems, 
          where voice signals from multiple users are multiplexed over a 
          single communication channel.
        - Characteristics:
          - Synchronous TDM: Fixed time slots are assigned to each channel, 
            whether data is present or not.
          - Asynchronous TDM: Time slots are dynamically assigned based on the 
            presence of data.
      
      - Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):
        - Mechanism: FDM divides the frequency spectrum into multiple distinct 
          frequency bands, each allocated to a different channel. Each channel 
          transmits simultaneously on its own frequency, without interference 
          from others.
        - Example of Use: FDM is used in traditional analog radio and 
          television broadcasting, where different stations operate on 
          different frequency bands.
        - Characteristics:
          - Requires guard bands (small frequency gaps) to prevent 
            interference between adjacent channels.
          - Suitable for analog and digital signals




2a. Define Network Switching?
ans: Network Switching refers to the process of directing data 
     packets or circuits through a network from the source to 
     the destination

b. Explain its importance in computer networks?
ans: - Efficiency Data Routing
     - Scalability
     - Resource Management
     - Fault Tolerance
     - Quality of Service (QoS)

     Explained:
     - Efficient Data Routing: Switching enables data to be 
       directed through the most efficient paths in a network, 
       optimizing the use of network resources and improving 
       overall performance.
     - Scalability: It allows networks to handle a large number 
       of simultaneous connections and data flows by managing 
       how data is transmitted and routed.
     - Resource Management: Switching helps in the effective 
       utilization of network resources by dynamically 
       allocating bandwidth and managing data traffic.
     - Fault Tolerance: It provides mechanisms for rerouting 
       data in case of network failures or congestion, ensuring 
       reliable communication.
     - Quality of Service (QoS): Switching can prioritize 
       different types of traffic to ensure that high-priority 
       data (e.g., voice or video) receives the necessary 
       bandwidth and low latency.

c. Compare and contrast the 3 main types of network Switching
   - Circuits Switching
   - Massage Switching
   - Packet Switching
ans: 1. Circuit Switching
     - Transmission of data between two nodes are done over 
       a dedicated communication path.
     - A pre-specified route is created for which data 
       travels and no other data is permitted.
     - Transmission in circuit switching have to go through 
       three phases.
       - Establish a circuit
       - Transfer the data.
       - Disconnect the circuit
     Circuit switching are primarily design for voice communications. Before a user can make a call, a virtual path between caller and callee is established over the network.

     2. Message Switching
     - This technique is somewhere in middle of circuit 
       switching and packets switching.
     - In message switching, the whole data is treated as a 
       data units, and is transmitted in its entirety (whole).
     - A switch receives the whole data unit and buffers it 
       until there are resources available to transfer it to 
       the next node.
     - If the next node does not have enough resource to 
       accommodate the data unit, the data unit have to waits 
       on the current node.
     - Message switching has the following drawbacks
     - Every switch in the transit path needs enough storage 
       to accommodate entire message.
     - Because of the store-and-forward technique and waits 
       of the availability of resources, message switching is 
       very slow.
     - Message switching is not suitable for real time 
       application.

     3. Packet Switching
     - Transmission data is broken down into smaller chunks 
       called packets.
     - A switching information is added in the header of each 
       packets.
     - Data transmission of packets over the network is done 
       independently.
     - These packets are sometime store on the intermediate 
       networking devices and they do not take much resources 
       either on carried path or in the memory of switches.
     - Packets switching enhances transmission efficiently as 
       packets from multiple communication channels can be 
       multiplexed.
     - The internet uses packets switching techniques.
     - Packet are stored and forwarded according to their 
       priority to providing quality of service.
