   <Number>         => <Digit> | <Number>
   <Digit>          => 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9 
   <Point>          => .

     <Number>    .142
     <Number><Point>      142
     <Number><Point><Number>    42

Ans: LMD is a scenario where we replace the LHS of the production to the RHS
     RMD is a scenario where we replace the RHS of the production to the LHS
     e.g Using the Production/Grammar:   S==>AB, A==>y, B==z

     LMD (start from left to right)
         S                 S                 S
      ___|___           ___|___           ___|___

      ___|___           ___|___           ___|___
     |       | ------> |       | ------> |       |

     2. Deciding the production rules by which the non-terminal is to be replaced
 
c. What are the 2 derivation methods?
Ans: Left-Most  Derivation (LMD)
     Right-Most Derivation (RMD)

d. If we scan a sentential form of an input and replace from left to right. What is this called?
Ans: Left-Most Derivation (RMD) 

Tip: An Example of LMD in use(Check Lecture 2, Question K)

e. Parse the sentence id+id*id Given the grammar E==>E+E|E*E|id. Use LMD & RMD?
Tip: The Grammar  E==>E+E|E*E|id  is the same as

     E==>E+E  or
     E==>E*E  or
     E==>id

Ans: LMD
     E==>E+E      # Replace 2nd E with E*E
     E==>E+E*E    # Perform LMD
     E==>id+E*E
     E==>id+id*E
     E==>id+id*id     # The sentence is valid ✅

     RMD
     E==>E+E      # Replace 2nd E with E*E
     E==>E+E*E    # Perform RMD
     E==>E+E*id
     E==>E+id*id
     E==>id+id*id     # The sentence is valid ✅

3. What is Parsing?
Ans: Parsing is the process of recognizing a string in a language by breaking it down to 
     a set of symbols and analyzing each of them against the grammer of the language

b. What are the 2 approaches to parsing?
Ans: Top-Down  Parsing
     Bottom-Up Parsing

c. What is the Top-Down Parsing?
Ans: It's the process of building derivation trees from the top(root) to the bottom (leaf)

d. What is the Bottom-Up Parsing?
Ans: It's the process of building derivation trees from the bottom (leaf) to the top(root)

e. What is a Parse Tree?
Ans: A parse tree is a graphical depiction of derivation

f. Draw the 2 possible Parse Tree for the Grammar - E==>E+E|E*E|id parsing id+id*id
Ans: 
         E                              E
    _____|_____                    _____|_____
   |     |     |                  |     |     |
   E     +     E                  E     *     E
   |       ____|____          ____|____       |
   id     |    |    |        |    |    |      id
          E    *    E        E    +    E
          |         |        |         |
          id        id       id        id

   LMD                       RMD
   
   The above also shows that the Grammar is Ambiguous


g. What are the 2 methods used to remove Ambiguity?
Ans: Precedence    (apply BODMAS)
     Associativity (use Brackets)

h. What is a sentential form?
Ans: 

i. Use the below Production Rule to generate a Sentential form and draw the parse tree 
   for the sentence - "The man ate the fruit".
   <S>   ==> <NP1><VP>
   <NP1> ==> <Art1><N1>
   <Art1>==> The
   <N1>  ==> man
   <VP>  ==> <v><NP2>
   <v>   ==> ate
   <NP2> ==> <Art2><N2>
   <Art2>==> the
   <N2>  ==> fruit

Ans:  Parse Tree

                                    <S>
                     ________________|_______________
                    |                                |
                  <NP1>                             <VP>
             _______|_______                   ______|_______
            |               |                 |              |
          <Art1>           <N1>              <V>           <NP2>
            |               |                 |          ____|_____
            |               |                 |         |          |      
            |               |                 |       <Art2>      <N2>
            |               |                 |         |          |       
           The             man                 ate     the       fruit


       Sentential Form

       <S> ==> <NP1><VP>                # Replace NP1
       <S> ==> <Art1><N1><VP>           # Replace VP
       <S> ==> <Art1><N1><v><NP2>       # Replace NP2
       <S> ==> <Art1><N1><v><Art2><N2>  # Perform LMD 
       <S> ==> The   <N1><v><Art2><N2>
       <S> ==> The   man <v><Art2><N2>
       <S> ==> The   man ate<Art2><N2>
       <S> ==> The   man ate the  <N2> 
       <S> ==> The   man ate the  fruit
