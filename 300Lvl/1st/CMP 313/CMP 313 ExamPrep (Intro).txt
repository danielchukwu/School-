How To Study the Material

Tips: 
- Best to study using the github repo link
  https://github.com/danielchukwu/School-/tree/master/300Lvl/1st

- Use a laptop or device with a relatively big screen to study
- Glancing through the questions and answers may not cement the knowledge. 
  But answering them as you go through them on some book or paper repeatedly 
  definitely will




1a. What is the Theory of Computation?
Theory of Computation is a branch of computer science that deals with how efficiently
a problem can be solved on a model of computation using an algorithm

b. Name the Three Branches of Theory of Computation? 
Ans: Automata Theory of Computation
     Computability Theory
     Complexity Theory

c. Discuss Automata Theory
Ans: Automata Theory covers the definitions and properties of plenty mathematical models of
     computation
     E.g   Finite Automata
           Context Free Grammer
           Turing Machine

d. Discuss Computability Theory
Ans: Computability Theory - covers what can and cannot be computed by the model of computation

e. Discuss Complexity Theory
Ans: Complexity Theory - groups computable problems based on their hardness

f. What is the main purpose of the Theory of Computation?
Ans: It is to develop formal mathematical model of computation that reflects real world 
     computers

g. What are Symbols with examples?
Ans: A symbol is a character 
     e.g a, b, c, ..., z
         0, 1, 2, ..., 9
         +, -, /, ..., special characters

h. What are Alphabets with examples?
Ans: An alphabet is a finite, non empty set of symbols. It is denoted by sigma(Σ)
     e.g Σ = {0, 1}
         Σ = {a, b, ..., z}  e.t.c

g. What is a String?
Ans: A string or a word is a finite sequence of symbols choosen from an alphabet
     e.g 011100110 is a string from binary alphabet Σ={0, 1}
         aabbaacab is a string from lowercase alphabet Σ={a, b, c }

h. What is an Empty String?
Ans: A string with zero occurences of symbols (no symbol). It is denoted by epsilon (ε)

i. What is used to denote the Length of a String?
Ans: It is denoted with 2 pipes => |w|
     e.g: a = 010110101 from binary alphabet Σ={0,1}
          The length of string |a| = 9

j. Contatenate the below Strings?
   a = a1a2a3 ... an
   b = b1b2b3 ... bn
Ans: ab = a1a2a3 ... anb1b2b3 ... bn

FORMAL GRAMMERS

2. What are languages?
Ans: A language can be formally defined as any system of formalized symbols, signs, e.t.c
     used for communication

b. What are Grammars?
Ans: A grammer can be defined as a set of structural rules that govern sentences, words, 
     e.t.c. in a natural language

c. What language does the computer understand?
Ans: Machine Language (which is in 0's and 1's)

d. Give me the 4 steps that is taken by the compiler to compile a high level language code?
Ans: 1. Source Code: Reads the code from the programmer
     2. Lexical Analyzer: groups the characters and words in a way that makes sense for the language
     3. Syntax Analyzer: checks that the characters/words are syntactically correct
     4. Semantic Analyzer: checks that the program as a whole makes actual sense

e. How does the Top-down parse tree work?
Ans: It starts with a "start-symbol" representing what you are translating, and then it
     deconstructs it using a set of given possible rules (uses left-side derivation) 
     for the language to then reach the sentence you have

f. How does the Bottom-up parse tree work?
Ans: It starts with the symbols in your sentence and tries to match them with valid
     representations in the language (uses right-side derivation) to combine those to 
     form other parts of the language, until you eventually end up with the Start symbol

g. Draw a top-down parse tree example?
Ans: 
Sentence                           (Top-down parsing tree)

|         |         |
Subject   |        object
|         |         |____________________
|         |         |         |         |
Noun     verb     article  adjective   noun
|         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |
|         |         |         |         |
I        am         a        good    programmer


h. Top-down is usually easy to make, but bottom-up usually works better (especially with 
   computer programming). True or False?
Ans: True

i. digit => 0 | 1 means?
Ans: digit can either be 0 or 1

j. Given the Grammer below
   exp   => A + A
   A     => digit | A * A
   digit => 0 | 1
   
   Check if the sentences below are valid
   a. 1*0+1 
   b. 1+1+1*11

Ans: 
    a.
    Exp => A + A
        => A * A + A
        => digit * digit + digit
        => 1 * digit + digit
        => 1 * 0 + digit
        => 1 * 0 + 1

        result = this sentence is valid

    b.     
    Exp => A + A
        => A * A + A
        => A * A * A + A
        => 1 * 1 * 1 + 11

        result = this sentence is not valid

k. What are Ambiguous Grammars?
Ans: This is a context-free grammar for which there exists a string that can have more than
     1 parse tree

l. What is another name for Grammars?
Ans: Production Rules
