1a. A client has requested for an ATM simulator desktop application that uses the
    fingerprint of users for authentication. (Since each individual has a unique one),
    this method of using fingerprint as a means of authentication to access your
    ATM is safer  and more secure than using an ATM card. Users need not carry 
    their ATM cards with them at all times - they can use their fingerprint to
    access ATM services
    To use the fingerprint-based ATM system, users have to log in to their account
    using their fingerprint. After logging in, once they provide their unique pin,
    they can conduct all kinds of banking transactions, from withdrawing cash to 
    money transfer, and even viewing their account balance. Furthermore, users can
    also check the last five transactions from their account


b. i. List the functional and Non functional Requirements of the proposed system
Ans:  Functional requirements:
      - Fingerprint authentication for logging into the ATM simulator
      - Ability to conduct various banking transactions such as cash withdrawal, 
        money transfer, and viewing account balance
      - Check last five transactions from the account
      
      Non-functional requirements:
      - Security and protection of user's personal and financial information
      - User-friendly interface
      - Reliability of the system and minimal downtime
      - Compatibility with different types of fingerprint scanners
      - Compliance with industry standards and regulations for banking systems.

     - Questionnaires
     - Interviews
     - Prototyping
     - Joint requirements planning

    Explanation
    - Observation
        Observation is a fact-finding technique wherein the systems analyst either
        participates in or watches a person perform activities to learn about the 
        system
        
        Advantages
        - Data gathered using Observation are highly reliable
        - Observation is not expensive compared to other fact-finding techniques
        - It allows the systems analyst to do work measurement

        Disadvantages
        - people are uncomfortable when watched
        - people may let you see what they want you to see
        - The tasks being observed are subject to interrupt

   - Questionnaire
       These are special-purpose documents that allow the analyst to collect 
       information and opinions from respondents
       
       Advantages
       - They can be answered quickly
       - They are not expensive
       - They allow respondents to remain anonymous

       Disadvantages
       - Number of respondents are often low
       - No guarantee an individual will answer and expand on all the questions
       - Impossible to analyze respondents body language
       - Good questionnaires are difficult to prepare

ii. List three(3) fact finding ethics in information systems development
Ans: - Protect the Security & Privacy of any fact or data
     - Do not discuss sensitive issues in public
     - Do not be careless. Your notes and documents should be kept safe



2. Mr. Jovan is a System Analyst by profession in TMR health care facility, he is
   saddled with the responsibility of computerizing the out-patient-department of 
   the OREXX health care facility. Mr. Anato a very close friend of Mr. Jovan has a 
   brother Mr. Val who is an admission with the OREXX health care facility

   One faithful day, Mr. Anato complained to Mr. Jovan about his brothers (Mr. Val)
   health condition, in response, Mr. Jovan said "aah Mr. val has cancer and may 
   not survive it, I saw the lab test and results in his file"

   Mr. Anato was shocked about this discovery because the doctors have not 
   officially disclose Mr. Val's health situation.

a. Comment on the behavior of Mr. Jovan (the analyst) with regards to ethics of a
   System Analyst
Ans: The behavior of Mr. Jovan in this scenario is highly unethical as a 
     System Analyst. By accessing and sharing confidential medical information 
     about a patient without authorization, Mr. Jovan has violated the patient's 
     privacy and trust. Additionally, his actions have potentially put the 
     patient's health and well-being at risk by sharing sensitive information 
     without the patient's consent or without it being officially disclosed by 
     the doctors. As a System Analyst, it is his responsibility to respect and 
     protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information he has access 
     to and to always act in the best interest of the patient. This behavior is 
     unacceptable and should be reported to the appropriate authorities.

b. What are the work ethics of Systems Analyst?
Ans: - maintaining confidentiality
     - acting in the best interest of the organization and its stakeholders
     - being unbiased and objective
     - maintaining professional conduct
     - adhering to industry standards and regulations
     - avoiding conflicts of interest

c. Differentiate between Verification and Validation Methods?
Ans: Verification testing 
       runs the system on simulated environment using simulated data
       - the simulated test is primarily looking for errors and omissions
         in the design and end-user specifications specified in earlier phases
         but not fulfilled during construction
     Validation   testing
       runs the system in a live environment using real data. It is sometimes called
       beta testing
       - typically performed by the end-user or a validation team
       - checks system performance


3a. List the phases of Software Development Life Cycle and explain?

    Explanation 
    1. Preliminary Study
         - This is also called `Trust phase`, `Initial study`, `planning phase` 
           and it answers the question "Is the project worth looking at".
           Extra: The things it must define to answer this question is
           - A scope of the project
           - Perceived problem
           - Opportunities
           - Directives that triggered the project
     2. Feasibility Study
         - it is the measure of how beneficial or practical the development of an 
           information system will be to an organization
           Extra: The 4 test fo feasibility are
           - operational 
           - technical
           - schedule
           - economic
     3. Detailed System Study
         - Studying the system and understanding how it works
     4. System Analysis
         - it is a problem-solving technique that decomposes the System into 
           component pieces for the purpose of studying how well those components
           work and interact to accomplish their purpose
     5. System Design
         - it is a complementary problem-solving technique that reassembles a Systems
           component pieces back into a complete system. Hopefully an improved one.
     6. Coding
         - this part is where developers actually write code and build the application
           according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications.
     7. Testing
         - Building software is not the end.
           Now it must be tested to make sure that there aren’t any bugs and that 
           the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point.
     8. Implementation
         - This phase is initiated after the system has been tested and accepted by 
           the user. In this phase, the system is installed to support the intended 
           business functions. System performance is compared to performance 
           objectives established during the planning phase.
           Then the system is delivered into production
     9. Maintenance
         - This is the process of maintaining the software system after it has been
           deployed. This includes monitoring the system for errors, making updates,
           and addressing any issues that arise.


b. What is the Purpose of Systems Construction and Implementation?
Ans: it is to develop and test functional systems that fulfils business and 
     design requirements and to also implement the interfaces between the 
     new System and the existing production systems

4a
 i. Project Initiation is the first phase of Software Development Method 
    (Project Initiation). it involves identifying projects for information System 
    Development. How are these projects initiated? Discuss.
Ans: Projects can be initiated in a number of ways, including:
     - Problems: 
          are understandable situations that prevent the organization from fully 
          achieving its purpose, goals and objectives
          e.g 
           A business might identify that it is taking too long to fulfill customer 
          orders. A project would be initiated to achieve more responsible and 
          timely order fulfillment. *Problem might be real, suspected or anticipated

     - Opportunity: 
          is a chance to improve the organization even in the absence of specific
          problem
          e.g
          Management is usually receptive of cost cutting ideas, even when costs 
          are not currently considered a problem. Opportunistic improvement is the
          source of many of today's most interesting projects.
         
     - Directive:
          is a new requirement that's imposed by management, government or some
          external influence.
          e.g
          In a government agency, they may mandate that a new set of reports be 
          produced each quarter.
        
          Some directives may be technical
          e.g. Converting inputs from key input through keyboard to using bar codes

ii. "Sure the system works, and is technically impressive but it just doesn't 
    do what is expected to do", Describe which phase in Software Development 
    Life cycle? List 2 tasks associated with the phase in question.
Ans: This statement describes the testing phase in the Software Development 
     Life cycle. 
     
     Tasks associated with this phase include:
     1. Conducting system testing to ensure the software meets the requirements 
        and specifications.
     2. Identifying and fixing bugs or issues found during testing.

iii. List 4 Principles of Software Development?
Ans: 1. Let the  users be involved
     2. Use the problem solving approach
     3. Establish phases and activities
     4. Establish standards
     5. Justify system as capital Investments
     6. Don't be afraid to Cancel or Revise Scope
     7. Divide and Conquer
     8. Design a system for Growth and Change


b.
i. Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements (Give Examples)
Ans: Functional requirements 
       What the system should do (features)
       E.g 
       - The system should allow users to create an account
       - The system should allow users to make online payments
       - The system should be able to generate reports

     Non-functional requirements 
       Constraints on how the System should do it (Quality)
       E.g
       - The system should have a response time of less than 2 seconds
       - The system should be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent users
       - The system should have a high availability of 99.99%
       - The system should be secure and protect user data
       - The system should be compatible with other systems or platforms.

ii. Why is correctly identifying requirements important?
Ans: Requirements provide the basis for project scope, design, development, 
     testing, and maintenance.


iii. What are the consequences of not getting the Requirements right?
Ans: - it can lead to project delays, 
     - cost overruns, 
     - project failure. 
     - a system that doesn't meet the needs of the users, 
     - a system that doesn't perform as expected
     - is not able to be integrated with other systems 
     
     Therefore, correctly identifying requirements is crucial for the success of 
     a project.


iv. Discuss the System Conversion Methods?
Ans: - Abrupt cut-over
     - parallel Conversion
     - Location Conversion
     - Staged   Conversion

    Discussion
     - Abrupt cut-over
         the old system is terminated and the new system is placed into operation
         - this is a high-risk approach because their may still be major problems 
           that won't be uncovered until the system has been in operations for at 
           least one business period
     - parallel Conversion
         both the old and the new systems are operated for sometime period. This 
         ensures that all major problems in the new System gets solved before the
         old system is discarded
     - Location Conversion
         when the same system would be used in numerous geo locations, it is 
         converted in one location first, when it is tested and trusted then it
         will be deployed to the other locations
     - Staged   Conversion
         this is based on the version concept introduced earlier. Each version of
         the new system is converted as it is developed
